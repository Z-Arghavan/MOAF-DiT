<span class="markdown">The MOAF-DiTO ontology is Wip.
It provides a semantic model for representing manufacturing operations in printed circuit board (PCB) production. The ontology captures work orders, operation executions, material requirements, machines, departments, personnel 
roles, and quality tests.

MOAF-DiTO is designed to support monitoring, analysis, and decision-making on the operational  floor with an outlook for reporting. It enables consistent representation of routing structures, operational sequences, material consumption, and test outcomes, allowing traceability of products and resources throughout the manufacturing process.

The ontology is intended to serve as a semantic backbone for knowledge graphs, AI and digital twin applications. It is extensible by design and aligns with open manufacturing and Industry 5.0 principles.</span>
