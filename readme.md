## Overview

MOAFDITO is a formal ontology developed to support **semantic interoperability for manufacturing-oriented digital twins**.  
It provides a structured vocabulary and machine-interpretable relationships for describing factory environments, processes, resources, roles, and operational dependencies.

## Scope and Objectives

MOAFDITO aims to:

- Provide a shared semantic model for factory digital twins  
- Enable interoperability between heterogeneous manufacturing data sources  
- Support reasoning over processes, machines, materials, and roles  
- Facilitate integration with linked data, knowledge graphs, and AI-driven analytics  

## Ontology Characteristics

- **Formal language:** OWL 2  
- **Serialisation:** RDF/XML  
- **Focus:** Manufacturing processes, resources, roles, locations, and dependencies  

## Usage

MOAFDITO can be used in digital twin platforms, manufacturing knowledge graphs, semantic validation workflows, and research prototypes requiring interoperable factory data.

## Ontology Visualisation

An interactive visualisation of the ontology is available via **WebVOWL**:

## Project and Contributors

This ontology is part of the **Multi-Ontology AI-based Facility Digital Twin (MOAF-DiT)** project at Eindhoven University of Technology.  
Project details can be found on TU/e’s research portal: https://research.tue.nl/en/projects/moaf-dit/ 

The project is led by **Prof. Dr. Bige Tunçer**  with contributions from **Dr. Arghavan Akbarieh**.

## Evaluation and Documentation

The ontology was assessed using **OOPS! (Ontology Pitfall Scanner!)** to identify common modelling pitfalls such as missing inverse properties and structural inconsistencies. Identified issues were reviewed to distinguish between actual modelling problems and intentional design decisions. Human-readable documentation for MOAFDITO was generated using **WIDOCO**, providing transparent access to classes, properties, and axioms to support reuse and inspection.
