## Overview

MOAFDITO is a formal ontology developed to support **semantic interoperability for manufacturing-oriented digital twins**.  
It provides a structured vocabulary and machine-interpretable relationships for describing factory environments, processes, resources, roles, and operational dependencies.

## Scope and Objectives

MOAFDITO aims to:

- Provide a shared semantic model for factory digital twins  
- Enable interoperability between heterogeneous manufacturing data sources  
- Support reasoning over processes, machines, materials, and roles  
- Facilitate integration with linked data, knowledge graphs, and AI-driven analytics  

## Ontology Characteristics

- **Formal language:** OWL 2  
- **Serialisation:** RDF/XML  
- **Focus:** Manufacturing processes, resources, roles, locations, and dependencies

)


## Usage

MOAFDITO is designed to use processes, products and routes in a factory digital twin, to create real-time as well as static knowledge graphs, provide semantically validated workflows, and AI-based digital twin prototypes requiring interoperable and trustworthy data.

## Ontology Visualisation

An interactive visualisation of the ontology is available via **WebVOWL**:

## Evaluation and Documentation

The ontology was assessed using **OOPS! (Ontology Pitfall Scanner!)** to identify common modelling pitfalls and syntax errors. Identified errors were reviewed and adjusted if needed. Human-readable documentation for MOAFDITO was generated using **WIDOCO**.
